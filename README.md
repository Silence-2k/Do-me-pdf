# Daggerheart Campaign PDF Generator

This project provides a modern workflow to create beautiful, two-column PDF documents for tabletop RPG campaigns (like Daggerheart) using Markdown. It uses a custom LaTeX template, Pandoc Lua filters, and an organized folder structure to make the process easy—even for users with no LaTeX experience.

## Features
- Write your campaign in Markdown: Easy, readable, and portable.
- Automatic conversion to PDF: Produces a professionally styled, two-column PDF.
- Custom adversary blocks: Add adversaries using simple Markdown/YAML blocks.
- Image support: Effortlessly include images—single column, double column, or full page.
- Cross-platform scripts: Run on Windows, Linux, or Mac with a single command.

## Setup

1. Install [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) (Make sure Pandoc is available in your system’s PATH.)
2. Install LaTeX
    - **Linux**: Install TeX Live or another LaTeX distribution.
      ```
      sudo apt install texlive-xetex
      ```
    - **Mac**: Install MacTeX from [tug.org](https://www.tug.org/mactex/).
    - **Windows**: Install MiKTeX from [miktex.org](https://miktex.org/download).
3. Install pandoc-latex-environment filter
   1. Install [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) if you haven't already.
   2. Run the following command to install the filter:
   ```
   pipx install pandoc-latex-environment
   ```
4. Clone this repository or download the files to your local machine.

## Writing Your Campaign

Write your content in main.md using standard Markdown.

Use the following YAML at the top of main.md to set the title, subtitle, and author:
  - Set `toc: true` to enable a table of contents.
  - Do not remove the mandatory fields for the LaTeX environment.

```yaml
---
title: Title of the Campaign
subtitle: Subtitle of the Campaign
author: Name of the Author
toc: false
# Mandatory fields. Please do not remove.
pandoc-latex-environment:
  squarebox: [squarebox]
  roundedbox: [roundedbox]
---
```

## Adding Images

- Place your images in the `images/` directory.
- To add images, use the following syntax:
```markdown
![](images/filename.ext)
```

## Adding Full-Page elements

- Be cautious with full-page elements, as they will break the two-column layout and start a new page.
- To add a full-page element, use the `fullpagestart` and `fullpageend` commands:
```markdown
\fullpagestart

This is a full-page element. It will take up the entire page, breaking the two-column layout.

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 | Header 4 | Header 5 | Header 6 | Header 7 | Header 8 | Header 9 |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Item 1   | Item 2   | Item 3   | Item 4   | Item 5   | Item 6   | Item 7   | Item 8   | Item 9   |
| Item 4   | Item 5   | Item 6   | Item 7   | Item 8   | Item 9   | Item 10  | Item 11  | Item 12  |
| Item 7   | Item 8   | Item 9   | Item 10  | Item 11  | Item 12  | Item 13  | Item 14  | Item 15  |

\fullpageend
```

## Custom Blocks

- Use the `squarebox` class to create visually distinct boxes in your text:

```markdown
::: squarebox
**This is a box title**
This is a quote from a character in the campaign. *It should be visually distinct from the rest of the text*, perhaps with a different font or style.
:::
```

- For rounded boxes, use the `roundedbox` class:

```markdown
::: roundedbox
**This is a rounded box title**
This is a quote from a character in the campaign. *It should be visually distinct from the rest of the text*, perhaps with a different font or style.
:::
```

- For quotes, you can use the `>` syntax to create a blockquote:

```markdown
> ***Note***: This is a quote from a character in the campaign. *It should be visually distinct from the rest of the text, perhaps with a different font or style*.
```

## Adversaries

- For adversaries, use the `adversary` class:
  - The `name`, `type`, `description`, `tactics`, `difficulty`, `thresholds`, `hp`, `atk` and `weapons` fields are mandatory.
  - `experience` and `features` fields are optional.

```markdown
::: adversary
name: Vampire, The Bloodthirsty
type: Tier 2 Solo
description: A fearsome vampire that preys on the weak.
tactics: Attack from shadows, drain blood
difficulty: 15
thresholds: 16 / 30
hp: 8
atk: +4
weapons:
  - Fangs: Close | 2d8+2 (Magical)
experience: Bloodthirsty Knowledge +3
features:
  - Blood Drain - Action: Make an attack against a target within Close range. On a success, deal 2 and the target must mark an Armor Slot without gaining its benefit (they can still use armor to reduce the damage)
  - Shadow Step - Action: Move to a location within Close range, ignoring terrain.
:::
```

## Environments
- For environments, use the `environment` class:
  - The `name`, `type`, `description`, `impulses`, `dificulty` and `adversaries` fields are mandatory.
  - The `features` field is optional.

```markdown
::: environment
name: The Dark Forest
type: Tier 1
description: A dense forest filled with shadows and danger.
impulses: Explore, Survive, Escape
difficulty: 10
adversaries: Goblin Scout, Shadow Beast
features:
  - Dense Trees: Provides cover and concealment.
  - Hidden Paths: Allows for stealthy movement.
:::
```

## Generating the PDF

### Option 1: Run the script (recommended)
- Windows: Double-click generatepdf.bat or run it from the command prompt.
- Linux/Mac: Open a terminal, navigate to the project folder, and run:
    ```bash
    ./generatepdf.sh
    ```
The script will:
- Check if Pandoc is installed.
- Convert input/document.md to output/document.pdf using your template and filters.

### Option 2: Run Pandoc manually
From the project root, run:

1. Run the following command to build the .html file
```
pandoc main.md --no-highlight --template=tex/template.tex --pdf-engine=xelatex --filter pandoc-latex-environment --lua-filter=filters/filters.lua -o output/main.pdf
```

## Helpful Tips
- Images: Place all images in input/images/ and reference them as images/filename.ext in your Markdown.
- Adversaries and custom blocks: Use the provided YAML/Markdown syntax for easy entry and automatic styling.
- Troubleshooting: If you get errors, ensure Pandoc and LaTeX are correctly installed and that your image paths are correct.
- Sometimes special characters in tables (like `#`, `&`, etc.) can cause issues. If you encounter problems, try escaping them with double backslash (`\\#`).
- Use the example.md file as a reference for formatting and structure.
